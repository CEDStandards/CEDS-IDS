# CEDS Integrated Data Store (IDS)
The CEDS Integrated Data Store factors the entities and attributes of the CEDS Domain Entity Schema (DES) with standard technical syntax and 3rd normal form database normalization. The IDS Logical Model provides a standard framework for integration of P-20 data systems through a well-normalized “operational data store”. In a P-20 data system, the IDS models the most current view of data available to the enterprise, including some historical data (such as prior assessment data and enrollment records). A “record” is generally added for each Person-Organization Relationship change event in the system. This CEDS logical model does not directly address the production aspects of log and change management.
